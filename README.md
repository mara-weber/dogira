# DOGIRA Manual

This is a community effort to help us keep our mission to moon on track!

## Overview

DOGIRA is a new ERC-20 token on the Etherum mainnet, that is taking community contributions and "buying the dip", both of which made HOGE moon so quickly, to a next level. Instead of just chants, you get actual rewards for these actions via token mechanics. This project has been audited by WarOnRugs, partnered with the successful FEG token and has its liquidity locked for 3 months.

Every 10th buy gets a substantial bonus. If you buy quickly after a sell, you get an extra boost as well.
Every transaction redistributed 1% to all holders (you earn interest just by holding, no staking needed) and 1% goes into a special wallet called Dogecity. That wallet is used to reward community members for their contributions (DOGEBLISS) and has a payout limit of 5% of the balance (i.e. can't be dumped on us). Besides the reward you will also earn XP for contributing, which will lower your buy and sell fees!

Each txn has a 1% tx fee that is split across all holders and 1% doge fee for Dogecity. Dogecity is a community fund that is used to reward contributions. If you post memes, post on reddit, or do other kinds of activities that help spread the word, you can apply for [Dogebliss](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tPeKvO25rRLUOKpCm8nnvtAZko2MK9j8K9fuFIs7Q7U/viewform?edit_requested=true), which will pay out 0.001% to 0.1% of the Dogecity reward pool. To prevent dumping, Dogecity can only pay out up to 5% per day. 
Each buy has a buy fee that will go into a prize pool, buy fee is calculated by buy weight. The more you buy, the smaller the fee. Every 10th buy awards that particular buyer the whole prize pool accumulated during the past 9 buys. Additionally, every buy gets a buy bonus that is powered by sell fees (5% sell fee). That means if you are the first to buy after a series of sells, you get all of summed up 5% fees those sellers were charged on top of the balance you purchased. Neato, right? Eat those dips!!

DOGIRA still is less than 1/100th the valuation of of HOGE and less than 1/10000th of DOGE. If you missed out before, wait no longer!

There are two main community functions that anyone can call every 10 minutes. Either `verysmashed` to burn 2% of the liquidity pool, or `dogebreath` to redistribute 2% of the liquidity pool across all holders.

This goes farther than HOGE. DOGIRA heavily incentives contributions, penalizes selloffs and encourages buying the dips. It also encourages buying frequently for additional rewards. If you buy larger amounts, the bonuses you get should offset the transaction fees!

### Presale Details

The presale is of course over now, but for reference...

* Token amount: 48 million (48%)
* Hard Cap: 50 ETH
* Soft Cap: 15 ETH
* Presale Price: 1 ETH = 960,000 DOGIRA ($0.0017)
* Uniswap Price At Listing: 1ETH = 800,000 DOGIRA $(0.002) (presale buys at 20% discount)

80% of raised ETH was used for Uniswap liquidity. 20% of raised ETH covered costs for launch, audit, and front-end. The rest for the team.

## How To Support Dogira

HOGE succeeded because of its unique community. We need to create a similar environment for Dogira to moon as well. 

### Telegram
We should all follow a few rules in the chat:
* Be welcoming! As new people come, questions will get asked over an over again. Point them here. I will keep an FAQ.
* Some people will say it's a scam. There are many DOGE scams popping up every day. It's a legitimate concern. Don't get angry. Kindly redirect them here, so they may read up on what they don't know...  
* If a question is asked repeatedly in the chat, but not in this FAQ, send a message to me ("Mara Weber", search in the channel) on Telegram. I will add it.
* Dips are healthy. At Dogira we BUY the dips. There are no dips, there are only opportunities to load up more. We need to eat red candles like candy. FUDers should be banned.

Now we got that over with, let's look at other ways to help.

### Spread The Word!

When you spread the word about Dogira, please always point out the following whenever you mention it:
* Dogira was audited by "War On Rugs"
* Dogira has partnered with FEG
* Dogira's liquidity is locked
* Include a link to this README (until the official website has something to replace it)
* Remember: Scammers are everywhere. Say whatever you want about Dogira, it should also be unique! But always include the above things to ensure that people don't think this is just another scam coin!!!

You can spread the word in Telegram channels, but make sure to check if there was a message about Dogira recently. We don't want to spam channels, it's annoying and it will deter people from joining Dogira!

## FAQ

#### Why Is The Uniswap Router Selling?
It's a UI bug, Dextools is looking into it, but the correct sellers are selling and balances are 100% fine. Purely a UI bug. (you can double check this on Etherscan)

#### Why do I have more DOGIRA Than I Bought?

Someone called a rebase, OR you could've won the 10th buy bonus.

#### Why Can't I Sell?

Set 7-10% min slippage for this project, try whole numbers, but don't be a paper hand. We penalize sells, that's why you need more slippage.

#### What About The FEG Partnership?

They advertise about Dogira in their Telegram pinned posts. So we will see an influx of their userbase as well.

#### How Can I Call The Special Tokenomics Functions?

There is a tutorial [here](https://muskandre.medium.com/how-to-interact-with-a-contract-manually-1181b06bf5c). I hope we will get a GUI for this soon, but for now in short:
1. Go to the contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x4b86e0295e7d32433ffa6411b82b4f4e56a581e1#writeContract
1. Click `Connect To Web3` at the top and connect with your wallet (e.g. Metamask)
1. There are several free-to-call functions under `Read Contract` (https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b86e0295e7d32433ffa6411b82b4f4e56a581e1#readContract)   
    1. `GetTimeTillNextAttack`: If zero, then you can call `dogebreath` or `verysmashed` (see below). If greater than zero, these are still cooling down and calling them would not achieve anything.
1. Decide which function to call under `Write Contract` (https://etherscan.io/token/0x4b86e0295e7d32433ffa6411b82b4f4e56a581e1#writeContract):
    1. `dogebreath`: Redistribute token supply across holders (2%)
    1. `verysmashed`: Burn the token supply (2%)
    1. `dogeit`: Bet on the bonus pool. The amount needs to be specified in `Wei`. If you don't know what that is, don't call this function :).

With the current ETH fees, I think only `dogebreath` is worth calling once every now and then to enrich all holders.
